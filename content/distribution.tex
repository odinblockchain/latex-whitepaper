\section{ODIN Coin Distribution}
The Foundation will initially hold, and never exceed, 15\% of the total supply in a ``reserve wallet.'' This reserve wallet will ensure active development can be guaranteed even during times of low liquidity or possible market issues that may reduce cash flow.

The amount taken out of each stake reward for the governance pool will be 20\%.
\begin{itemize}
   \item 10\% of this is given directly back to the community in the form of a community treasury to support development of projects voted on by the masternode holders.
   \item 10\% is spent through the governance treasury to support operational costs of the Foundation (these costs will be made transparent through a Governance report at the end of each financial quarter).
   \item The Foundation's core reserve holdings will never exceed 15\% of the total supply, and will gradually decrease over time.
   \item The Foundation will never stake these core reserve holdings.
\end{itemize}

All the other coins in the total supply will be held strictly by the community.
